# Youtube-API-Analyzer
[Project code](youtube_videos_analyzer_EDA.ipynb) using the YouTube API to analyze information about channels
related to the world of information technology (IT) in order to obtain valuable information
needed by a future content creator who wants to start a new channel on the platform

## Aims and Objectives

Within this project, I would like to explore the following:

- Getting to know Youtube API and how to obtain video data.
- Analyzing video data and verify different common "myths" about what makes a video do well on Youtube, for example:
    - Does the number of likes and comments matter for a video to get more views?
    - Does the video duration matter for views and interaction (likes/ comments)?
    - Does title length matter for views?
    - How many tags do good performing videos have? What are the common tags among these videos?
    - Across all the creators I take into consideration, how often do they upload new videos? On which days in the week?
- Explore the trending topics using NLP techniques
    - Which popular topics are being covered in the videos (e.g. using wordcloud for video titles)?
    - Which questions are being asked in the comment sections in the videos
